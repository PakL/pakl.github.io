	<h1>I'm a programmer</h1>
	<h2>Primarily web-development but I also make other stuff</h2>
</hgroup>

<h3>Languages I'm familiar with</h3>
<p><small>In order of experience.</small></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>PHP</strong><br>
		I've been programming in PHP for over 20 years now. If I need something done quick, this is the language I use.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>JavaScript</strong><br>
		Naturally used for interactable frontends. I'd use HTMX over React every time. There are very few instances
		where I use JavaScript on a server. Most of these instances are Discord bots. I use NodeJS in Electron for my
		TTVStreamerTool.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Java</strong><br>
		I programmed a bunch of Java between 2011 and 2014. Could probably get back into it fairly easy but would need a
		small refresher. Especially in changes that happened to Java since then.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Rust</strong><br>
		I program small things in Rust since 2023 here and there. It's a fun language to write in. It shines most when
		using it synchronously.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Go</strong><br>
		Just getting into Go. It's very easy to get something working compared to Rust. Not particularly fond of the
		error handling, but it's better than throw/catch that PHP and JavaScript have.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Others</strong><br>
		I have also dabbled in C#, Python and Lua. They are fairly easy to pick up but I would probably never write a
		major project in them.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notable projects I can share</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="https://ttvst.app/" target="_blank">TTVStreamerTool</a></strong><br>
		Tool for Twitch-Streamer with OBS-Overlays and stuff.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="https://github.com/PakL/SkyrimIntegrationBridge" target="_blank">SkyrimIntegrationBridge</a></strong><br>
		A Skyrim mod that enables you to spawn NPCs, items and more into your world from various sources. Also my first
		Rust project.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="https://github.com/PakL/savegame_manager" target="_blank">Savegame Manager</a></strong><br>
		Inspired by <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma2/mods/52" target="_blank">Lennard Fonteijn's DD2
		Save Manager</a>. It watches a folder for changes, creates backups and takes screenshots. Perfect for games like
		Dragons Dogma.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>My path</h3>
<div class="timeline">
	<div>
		<h4>2024</h4>
		<p>As web development in Rust is extremely verbose I looked into Go lang and wrote a simple implementation
			of FCGI in it. Later started to rewrite the first application at work in Go.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4>2023</h4>
		<p>I started learning Rust. Later that year I created a Skyrim mod that used a companion program, written in
			Rust. The companion program takes web requests and writes JSON files to the Skyrim folder for JContainer to
			read.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4>2017</h4>
		<p>Started work on TTVStreamerTool - a tool for streamer, at first as a Twitch chat client and a tool to host
			local overlays.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4>2016</h4>
		<p>PHP 7 released and I was excited to migrate my applications to it. This will take a lot of time. In my free
			time I write my first Node-based desktop application first with NW.js then with Electron.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4>2011</h4>
		<p>The company that I was working at hired me right out of my apprenticeship since I was still working on some
			ongoing projects. As I was increasingly involved in data processing I wanted to check out strictly typed
			languages for better performance. So I took to learning Java as a starting point. Confusing licenses from
			Oracle made working with it painful, and I lost interest eventually.</p>
		<p>However, the first NodeJS build for Windows releases around this time and I start experimenting with it.
			Creating full applications at work is still not in the cards, as my PHP knowledge outperforms anything I
			could creating using JavaScript and NodeJS.</p>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4>2007</h4>
		<p>Began my apprenticeship and started working on a web-based application to replace an Excel file that was
			used to request data from a MSSQL database. This allowed me to learn more about authentication (via LDAP),
			different SQL engines (as I only had worked with MySQL up to that point) and working with large data sets.</p>
		<p>Working with a web-based solution allowed me to patch issues fast and increase productivity of my co-workers
			on a near-daily basis.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4>2004</h4>
		<p>Started learning HTML, CSS and later PHP and created my first few websites. One of them updated its header
			regularly with an image of the <a href="https://www1.wdr.de/domcam102.html" target="_blank">WDR webcam</a>
			pointed at the cologne cathedral. Only gained rudimentary knowledge about JavaScript as NodeJS was still
			a couple years away.</p>
