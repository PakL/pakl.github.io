A few months ago (back in January) I started making Skyrim mods for the great [Melzii](https://www.twitch.tv/melzii) community.
They are a few memes that popped up and stuck with this community in the very early streams. I combined them in one download over at NexusMods as [Melzii's Wild Ride](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45050).

It started off with spicy milk and as I learned more about scripting I added a new disease and a drink that teleports you to a random inn.
The biggest part was creating the famous spicy milk mascot Leche Picante, a flaming hot skeleton friend that breaths fire on his enemies. Another community member Shrimpathy created a combat theme for him that has a chance to play whenever Leche attacks an enemy.
