	<h1>Photography</h1>
	<h2>Sometimes I take pictures</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>Photography has always been a family thing. And I don't mean taking pictures. Everyone can take pictures with a
	camera. But actually taking time to observe your surroundings and framing your picture. It has something meditative.
</p>
<p>I'm also exploring stereo photography, you can check <em>that</em> out <a href="//stereo.pakl.dev">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some photos I took.</p>
